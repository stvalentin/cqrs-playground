`docker-machine create app`

`docker-machine start app`

`eval $(docker-machine env app)`

`docker-compose up --build`

`docker-compose rm app`


**Note:** you need to cd first to where your docker-compose.yml file lives.

  * Start containers in the background: `docker-compose up -d`
  * Start containers on the foreground: `docker-compose up`. You will see a stream of logs for every container running.
  * Stop containers: `docker-compose stop`
  * Kill containers: `docker-compose kill`
  * View container logs: `docker-compose logs`
  * Execute command inside of container: `docker-compose exec SERVICE_NAME COMMAND` where `COMMAND` is whatever you want to run. Examples:
        * Shell into the PHP container, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bash`
        * Run symfony console, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bin/console`
        * Open a pgsql shell, `docker-compose exec pgsql pgsql -uroot -pCHOSEN_ROOT_PASSWORD`


Cleaning our your machine:
====
Before deleting all the containers, force stop them:
`docker ps -q -a | xargs docker stop`

Then delete the containers using:
`docker ps -q -a | xargs docker rm`

Now delete all the dangling images using:
`docker rmi $(docker images | grep “^<none>” | awk ‘{print $3}’)`
